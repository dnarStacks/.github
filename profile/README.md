[dnar](https://dnar.io) is a unique digital wallet app using which you are able to send or receive money without any hassle. dnar aims to help, bring financial freedom to the under banked in Ghana and West Africa.


We are now developing our next product which is called **dnarStacks** which is a Decentalized Finance Solution.

## Background

dnarStacks is a Decentalized Finance Solution that will provide the user’s ability to get loan without paying any interest unlike how banking system works. By means Decentralized dnarStacks will be built on top of bitcoin blockchain which is a rigid and secured decentralized coin. 
With dnarStacks you won’t be required to pay any monthly loan fee your loan will be completely paid automatically through a period of time which happens due to a mechanism called Yeild Farming.
 
 
## How dnarStacks will work

You will collateralize your STX tokens and gain 100% of the value stable coin. We will lock the collateralize STX tokens and do yeild farming from it that will pay off the loan for the loan borrowering user’s with time and giving you who collateralized their STX, interest in return which you can either get directly to your Stacks Wallet or in your Wise wallet in dnar mobile application both will be co-linked to each other so you don't have to worry about anything. The major benefit to user about dnarStacks is beneficial for both lender and borrower, both can stick to just one platform which will be dnar application. If you want to collateralize you can do that without any hassle from the dnar application and if someone wants to take the loan they can do that from inside the dnar applicatication as well so the mobility we are offering has no match.  

## Platforms Availability

dnarStacks will be offered in dnar app and in a web format as well no matter you are a dnar app user or not you still will be able to use dnarStacks. dnar is available for android and iOS.

## Implementation

Over the course of 5-6 months dnarStacks will be publicly available to use. dnarStacks will be available online at [dnar's website](https://dnar.io) once it will be ready. Alternatively you will be able to use dnarStacks using the dnar mobile application.
